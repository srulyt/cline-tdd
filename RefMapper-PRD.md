# RefMapper - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

RefMapper is an object mapping library that enables automatic data transformation between objects of different types. It solves the common business problem of converting data structures while maintaining data integrity and type safety.

## Business Problem

Software applications frequently need to transform data between different object structures for various purposes:
- Converting between data transfer objects (DTOs) and domain models
- Mapping database entities to API response models
- Transforming data between different service layers
- Creating deep copies of complex objects
- Converting legacy data formats to modern structures

Manual mapping code is time-consuming to write, error-prone, and difficult to maintain as data structures evolve.

## Business Value

### Productivity Benefits
- **Reduced Development Time**: Eliminates the need to write repetitive mapping code manually
- **Faster Feature Delivery**: Developers can focus on business logic instead of data transformation boilerplate
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Automatic mapping reduces the codebase that needs to be maintained

### Quality Improvements
- **Reduced Bugs**: Eliminates human errors in manual mapping implementations
- **Type Safety**: Ensures data type compatibility and catches mismatches early
- **Data Integrity**: Prevents data loss during transformations

### Business Agility
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Enables quick data structure changes without extensive mapping code updates
- **Schema Evolution**: Supports evolving data models with minimal code changes
- **Integration Flexibility**: Simplifies integration between systems with different data formats

## Target Users

- **Software Developers**: Primary users who need to transform data between objects
- **Solution Architects**: Design systems that require data transformation capabilities
- **DevOps Teams**: Benefit from reduced deployment complexity due to simpler codebases

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Basic Object Mapping
- **Property-to-Property Mapping**: Copy data between objects with matching property names
- **Type Compatibility Validation**: Ensure source and target properties have compatible types
- **Deep Object Mapping**: Handle nested objects and complex object hierarchies
- **Null Value Handling**: Properly handle null values in source objects

#### Collection Support
- **Array Mapping**: Transform arrays between compatible types
- **List Mapping**: Support various collection types (Lists, IEnumerables)
- **Collection Item Transformation**: Map individual items within collections
- **Mixed Collection Types**: Convert between different collection types (array to list, etc.)

#### Enum Handling
- **Name-Based Enum Mapping**: Map enums by matching value names
- **Enum Validation**: Detect and report when enum values cannot be mapped
- **Enum Collections**: Support collections of enum values

#### Object Creation
- **Automatic Instantiation**: Create target objects when they don't exist
- **Constructor Selection**: Choose appropriate constructors for object creation
- **Record Type Support**: Handle modern C# record types
- **Complex Constructor Parameters**: Support constructors with multiple parameters

#### Validation and Error Handling
- **Mapping Validation**: Verify mapping compatibility before execution
- **Clear Error Messages**: Provide descriptive errors when mapping fails
- **Property Mismatch Detection**: Identify when properties don't exist on target objects
- **Type Mismatch Reporting**: Report incompatible property types

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- **Efficient Mapping**: Minimize performance overhead during mapping operations
- **Memory Management**: Avoid unnecessary object allocations
- **Scalable Operations**: Handle large object graphs efficiently

#### Reliability
- **Predictable Behavior**: Consistent mapping results across different scenarios
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of mapping failures
- **Data Consistency**: Ensure complete data transfer or clear failure indication

#### Usability
- **Simple API**: Intuitive interface requiring minimal configuration
- **Generic Type Support**: Type-safe operations with generic methods
- **Flexible Usage**: Support both in-place mapping and new object creation

## Success Metrics

### Developer Productivity
- **Code Reduction**: Measure reduction in lines of mapping code
- **Development Speed**: Track time saved in feature development
- **Bug Reduction**: Monitor decrease in mapping-related defects

### System Performance
- **Mapping Speed**: Benchmark mapping operation performance
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption during mapping operations
- **Error Rates**: Track mapping failure rates in production

### Adoption Metrics
- **Usage Frequency**: Measure how often the mapper is used in applications
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Survey developer experience with the tool
- **Maintenance Effort**: Track time spent maintaining mapping code

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must work with .NET applications
- Should handle reflection-based operations efficiently
- Must maintain type safety throughout mapping operations

### Business Constraints
- Solution must be maintainable by existing development teams
- Implementation should not require extensive training
- Must integrate with existing development workflows

### Assumptions
- Objects being mapped follow standard .NET property conventions
- Target objects have appropriate constructors available
- Property names follow consistent naming conventions between source and target

## Conclusion

RefMapper addresses a fundamental need in software development by automating data transformation between objects. It provides significant business value through improved developer productivity, reduced maintenance burden, and enhanced code quality while maintaining the flexibility needed for complex data transformation scenarios.
