# ðŸ§® TDD Exercise: Mathematical Expression Calculator

## ðŸ“˜ Business Requirements

The goal of this project is to build a mathematical expression calculator using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**. The calculator will evolve through a series of phases, each introducing new features and complexity. Students will follow the **Red/Green/Refactor** cycle to implement each phase, reinforcing good TDD practices and clean code principles.

## ðŸ§  Learning Objectives

- Practice writing tests before implementation.
- Learn to refactor code as complexity increases.
- Understand parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions.
- Handle edge cases and error conditions gracefully.

## ðŸ§± Project Structure

Each phase builds on the previous one and introduces new requirements. Students must write failing tests (Red), implement the minimum code to pass (Green), and then refactor for maintainability (Refactor).

## ðŸ“ˆ Phases Overview

1. Basic Integer Addition
2. Addition and Subtraction
3. Multiple Operations (Left-to-Right Evaluation)
4. Operator Precedence (PEMDAS without Parentheses)
5. Whitespace Handling
6. Parentheses for Grouping
7. Negative Numbers
8. Floating Point Numbers
9. Error Handling

Each phase includes:
- Requirements
- Supported Operators
- Test Cases

Happy TDD-ing! ðŸš€
